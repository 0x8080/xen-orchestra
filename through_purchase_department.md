# Through purchase department

If you can't purchase for your own account, because you need to go through a dedicated purchase department in your company, this is the process you need to follow.

In means, there will be:

* a "billing contact" (in general, the purchaser email). This account will have access to invoices. And this is the account which make the purchase.
* a "technical contact", the email of the system administrator using the solution and making support requests.
