# Resources delegation

This chapter is about how to delegate resources (VM, hosts) to users.

The idea is to allow external users (not admins) to:

* interact only with their objects
* delegate VMs to your dev teams...
* ... or to your clients

> Remember: admins can do everything, thus permissions don't apply on them.

## Groups

Groups are a set of users. You can use groups to apply permissions/ACLs on a whole set of users, instead of repeating superfluous operations on multiple users separately.

## ACLs

ACLs are the permissions for your users.

### Groups



### Inheritance



## LDAP

## SSO
