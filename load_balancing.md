# Load balancing

Load balancing is feature coming for the end of 2015. The goal here is to distribute the VMs load in the best way possible on your servers.

Because Xen Orchestra is connected to multiple pools and XenServer support live storage motion, we can imagine load balancing on a **whole XenServer infrastructure** (even between remote Data Centers).

## Challenges

We are already capable to gather the metrics from all the hosts and VMs.
