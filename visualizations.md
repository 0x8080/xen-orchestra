# Visualizations

Visualizations help you to understand your own XenServer infrastructure, to correlate event and detect bottlenecks.

### Dashboard

The dashboard is a view gathering information on all your connected pools/hosts.

### Heatmap

A heatmap allows its reader to understand when your VMs or hosts are stressed. Values are relative, thus it's easy to detect trends or spikes.

### Sunburst

A sunburst visualization helps a lot to detect proportions in a hierarchical environment. Two cases with XenServer:

* VM disk usage in storage repositories
* VM RAM usage in hosts

### Event correlation

This is the place to compare metrics on comparable objects (VMs to VMs, hosts to hosts).
