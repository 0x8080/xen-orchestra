# Visualizations

> Visualization are available since 4.4

Visualizations help you to understand your own XenServer infrastructure, to correlate event and detect bottlenecks.

### Dashboard

The dashboard is a view gathering information on all your connected pools/hosts.

> You can also update all your hosts (install missing patches) from this place.

### Sunburst

A sunburst visualization helps a lot to detect proportions in a hierarchical environment. Two cases with XenServer:

* VM disk usage in storage repositories
* VM RAM usage in hosts
