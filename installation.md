# Installation

As you may have seen, in other parts of the documentation, XO is composed of two parts: [XO-Server](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server/) and [XO-Web](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web/).

They can be installed separatly, even on different machines, but for the sake of simplicity we will set them up together.

## Fetching the Code

You may either download them [here](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server/archive/master.zip) and [here](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web/archive/master.zip) or use `git` with these repositories from `git://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server.git` and `git://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web.git`.

## Installing dependencies

The only two dependencies you have to install by yourself is [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Redis](http://redis.io/). For more information you may check [this page](http://nodejs.org/download/) for the first and [this one](http://redis.io/) for the last.

Once you have it, you can use `npm` to install the other dependencies: go into XO-Server directory and launch the following command:

	npm install

## To be continued...

We'll publish the end of the procedure as soon as we can. Until then, we strongly recommand to use XO Appliance: everything is already installed and working.
