# others

We already have other modules in place, e.g for authentication, like a LDAP, SAML, Google or GitHub as external providers.

If you want to understand how modules work, get a look there:

* [LDAP plugin](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server-auth-ldap)
* [GitHub authentication](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server-auth-github)

XO's API can be explored through the `xo-cli` client (please refer to the previous section for details).

In the future, we'll add modules for:

* performance analysis
* reporting
* load management
* various authentication providers
