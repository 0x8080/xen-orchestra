# Forecaster

> This feature is planned for 2016.

Thanks to [machine-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), we should be able to analyze previous events (load evolution, RAM usage, etc.) and to forecast what would come next.

It could leads to:

* forecast report and alerts inside advanced reports
* taking automatic actions before bottlenecks happened
* match the resources needed for a predicted load

## Example

The system detects that every Monday, you got a huge CPU spike on some VMs. It could:

* report you this information
* scale up those VMs just before those spikes, and scale them down after
