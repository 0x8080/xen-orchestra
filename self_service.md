# Self Service

This feature is not yet available yet. Still, we already made a effort to design it.

## Set of resources

To allow people creating VMs as they want, we need to give them a *part* of your XenServer resources (disk space, CPUs, RAM). You can call this quotas if you like. But you need first to decide how those quota applies in your infrastructure:

* which hosts will be available for self-service?
* which Storage Repository?

Details are given in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web/issues/285). Feel free to contribute to help up!
