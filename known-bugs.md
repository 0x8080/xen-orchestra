# Known bugs

XO is currently under development and contains various known bugs/limitations.

We will try to list the most important here so that you know what to expect if you try it and that we are planning to fix them :)

## VNC Console

The VNC console works on Firefox but not on Chromium, furthermore it has not been tested with other browsers.

There are also lots of minor bugs such as:
* Links on the navigation bar are sometimes unclickable (first click on another tab).
