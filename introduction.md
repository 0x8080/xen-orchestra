# Introduction

Xen Orchestra (or XO) is a software created to visualize and administrate your XenServer hosts.

It aims to be easy to use on any device supporting modern web technologies (HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript) such as your desktop computer or your smartphone.

It also tends to become a tool to create a private Cloud on your XenServer infrastructure, in less than 5 minutes.

If you want to keep an eye on the project life, please [read our blog](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog).
