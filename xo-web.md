# xo-web

This is probably the first thing you'll see of Xen Orchestra. It's the Web interface, allowing to interact with your virtual infrastructure. As a module for XO-web, it facilitates the everyday Xen administrator work, but also provide a solution to delegate some part of your infrastructure to other people.

### JavaScript

We are also using JavaScript for XO-web: we stay consistent from the back-end to the front-end with one main language. [AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angularjs) and [Twitter Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_%28front-end_framework%29) are also powerful allies to our everyday development.
