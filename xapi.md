# Questions

Why some objects are linked by `OpaqueRef` and others by `UUID`?

Why values in `event.class` are lowercased?

Why isn't `event.snapshot` undocumented?

Why some of the `VM_metrics` are documented but not working anymore? (RRD seems the right way)

Why does `event.next` hang up when the pool master is changed instead of the proper error?
