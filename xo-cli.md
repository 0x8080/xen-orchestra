# xo-cli

After [a request from someone on our Github repositoryy](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server/issues/23), we decided to add the possibility to do some actions with CLI. Just few hours after the request, [we created XO-cli](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-cli). It's a real example of the Xen Orchestra modularity, and how we can be flexible.
