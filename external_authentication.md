# User authentication

Xen Orchestra support various type of user authentication, internal or even external thanks to the usage of [Passport library](http://passportjs.org/).

## Built-in

This method is the default one. Creating a user is very simple:

1. Go into the Settings view, select "Users"
2. You can create a *user* or an *admin*, with his password (or generate one)

By default, a *user* won't have any permission. At the opposite, an *admin* will have every rights.
