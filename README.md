Almost all dev for Xen Orchestra is happening in this repository.

Because transition is still underway,
[xo-web](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web) is still developed in
their own repositories.

For now, all issues are still to be reported in [xo-web's tracker](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web/issues).
