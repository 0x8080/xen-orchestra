# Xen Orchestra

XO is a web interface to visualize and administrate your [XCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen_Cloud_Platform) network.

It aims to be easy to use on any device supporting modern web technologies (HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript) such as your desktop computer or your smartphone.

XO is developped by [Vates SAS](https://vates.fr) a small French company and released under the [AGPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0-standalone.html) licence.

__XO is currently under development and may be subject to important bugs.__

## How to try XO?

XO is composed of two parts (the server and the interface) which have their own repositories.

The server is available at https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server and the interface at https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web.

Check their documentation to see how to use them.

## How to report a bug?

Xen Orchestra has three bugtrackers: [one for the server](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-server/issues), [one for the interface](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo-web/issues) and [the last one](https://github.com/vatesfr/xo/issues) for common issues or when you don't know to which part it is related to.
