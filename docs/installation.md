# Installation

There are two ways to install Xen Orchestra. If you are just a user and not a developer, please consider using the pre-built appliance, as this is the easier way (XOA).

## XOA credentials

* Web UI: `admin@admin.net` / `admin`
* Console/SSH: `root` / `xoa`

Remember to change both default password immediately after installation.
