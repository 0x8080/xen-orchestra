# Live filter search

The idea is not just to provide a good search engine, but also a complete solution for managing all your XenServer infrastructure. Ideally:

* less clicks to see or make what you want
* find a subset of interesting object
* make bulk actions on all results found
* sort your result for more pertinent insight

> Pro Tip: the URL of Xen Orchestra contains the search string, eg `home?s=power_state%3Arunning+`. You can share those URL to your colleagues to share your search!

## Search examples

We recorded some filters in the dropdown "Filters":

## Save your search

If you want to record your filter, just click on "Save" icon ![](./assets/xo5savefilter.png)

After giving a name to your filter, you can find it in the dropdown filter menu.

## Manage your saved search

Just go in your user zone (bottom of main left menu):

![](./assets/xo5usericon.png)

There, you can edit or remove any filter/search your created!

## Make a default search

In this user zone, you can set a default filter (preset filters or your own).

> Pro Tip: this is saved in your user preference. It means that you can connect anywhere on any browser, you'll find your preference.
