# File level restore

You can restore individual files against a whole VM. And it works on all your existing delta backups.

> You must use the latest XOA release. When you connect with the console, you should see `Build number: 16.12.20`. If you have this or higher (eg `17.*`), it means that's OK! Otherwise, please download your new XOA.

> Restore files from a SMB remote is not yet possible, but it's planned for the next release!

> File level restore **is only possible on delta backups**
