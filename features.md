# Features

All these features are exposed through the web client, XO-Web, which is using a [responsive design](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/xen-orchestra-responsive-design/).

## XenServer administration

This part is about everyday XenServer administration tasks.

### Infrastructure overview

The original motivation of XO was to provide a view to understand the whole infrastructure in a single page. In short, to answer the question: "where is my VM?".

### Live filter search

If you infrastructure starts to be big, it could be useful to find exactly what you need. It could be an IP address, a VM name, or a storage name: any object!

### Easy VM creation

Creating a VM should be trivial! That's why we are constantly improving our interface to display only what's necessary, but also allow the user to access advanced stuff when needed.

### VM import and export

You can import or export a VM directly on your computer, through your web browser.

### Auto patching

Patching a host manually could be time consuming (and boring). That's why we provide a high level feature downloading and applying patches automatically.

### Batch operations

### Drag'n drop live migration

### VDI live migration

Thanks to Xen Storage Motion, it's easy to move a VM disk from a storage to another, while the VM is on!
