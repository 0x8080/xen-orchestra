# Task manager

> Coming soon! Currently under active development.

Scheduler is not yet accessible through the UI (4.9), but we the back-end is ready!

The key idea is to be able to schedule any action (migrate, reboot etc.), like for backups, snapshots or DR.

## Examples

Do you ever wanted to plan a migration of your VMs from a host to another? Let's say every night at 11:00PM, let's do this, then shutdown the big noisy server.

At 06:00AM, start the big server, and 10 minutes later, migrate the same VM back.
